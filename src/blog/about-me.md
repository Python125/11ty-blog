  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center font-bold">My Cinematic Journey</h1>

  <p class="text-lg m-5">
    Growing up in the 2000s and 2010s, I have had the privilege of experiencing
    movies that included special effects. However, I've always had a fascination
    about what life was like before I was born. As a kid, I would watch movies
    that were from the 1960s, such as "Mary Poppins" (1964), "A Hard Day's
    Night" (1964), and "The Sound of Music" (1965) just to name a few. At the
    age of 12, I got my first experience with watching a classic movie entitled
    "Little Caesar", which was released in 1931. After that amazing experience,
    I became very enthusiastic about films from the early to early-mid 20th
    century, specifically focusing on the 1930s and 40s, also known as the
    classical Hollywood period. As I watched more movies from the classical
    Hollywood period, I was introduced to many Hollywood stars, such as Edward
    G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Bette Davis, and Barbara
    Stanwyck. These actors and actresses are why I have a passion for classic
    Hollywood films today.

    As my fascination with cinematic history continued to grow, I embarked on a
    journey that transported me to diverse and captivating realms of
    storytelling. This expedition began with the enchanting world of British
    horror films, specifically the atmospheric works of Hammer Productions from
    the late 1950s to the early 1970s. These films, featuring the timeless
    talents of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, etched a unique niche within
    the horror genre, leaving an enduring impression on my cinematic odyssey.
    From the shadowy castles of Hammer Horror Productions, my quest extended to
    the U.S., where I explored the haunting black-and-white landscapes of
    Universal Pictures' horror classics from the 1930s and 40s. In these films,
    the iconic portrayals of Dracula by Bela Lugosi and Frankenstein's Monster
    by Boris Karloff marked the inception of classic horror. Their performances,
    brimming with timeless allure and Gothic charm, captivated me and deepened
    my connection to the art of filmmaking. This exploration has enriched my
    understanding of cinematic heritage and shaped my appreciation for the
    artistry that spans continents and eras

    As I journeyed through the dynamic 1980s, the decade marked by vibrant
    creativity and cultural shifts, I was particularly drawn to the spirited
    realm of teen movies. From the coming-of-age charm of 'The Breakfast Club'
    (1985) to the time-traveling adventures of 'Back to the Future' (1985),
    these films resonated with me on a personal level, capturing the essence of
    youth, friendship, and self-discovery.

  <p class="text-lg m-5">
    My exploration of cinema continued to evolve, leading me to the masterful
    works of renowned directors. The visionary storytelling of Stanley Kubrick,
    the gritty realism of Martin Scorsese, and the distinctive style of Quentin
    Tarantino captured my imagination and deepened my understanding of film as
    an art form. From '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) to 'Goodfellas' (1990) and
    'The Hateful Eight' (2015), these directors showcased the unparalleled
    impact of a director's unique voice on the cinematic experience.

    influence of visionary directors. It has allowed me to appreciate the
