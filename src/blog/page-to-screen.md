Have you ever felt anticipation for a book-to-movie adaptation, only to find yourself disappointed by how the movie strays from the author's original intent? If so, you're not alone. This page is dedicated to examining the changes that movies often make when adapting from books. Join me as we explore these adaptations and the shifts that can occur between the written word and the silver screen.

      “Harry! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?!” asked Dumbledore
      angrily, as he ran towards Harry and grabbed him, shoving him back to the
      trophies. “No sir!” said Harry, showing fear and uncertainty. “Did you ask
      one of the older students to do it for you?!” asked Dumbledore, still
      angry. “No sir!” repeated Harry. “You're absolutely sure?!” asked
      Dumbledore, still angry. “Yes sir!” said Harry firmly.
    </p>

    <p>Huh?? What??</p>

    <p>
      NO. This is not what happened in the novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of
      Fire by J.K. Rowling!
    </p>

    <p>
      In the book, Dumbledore calmly asked, “Did you put your name into the
      Goblet of Fire, Harry?” to which Harry answered, “No.” Dumbledore then
      asked another question calmly, “Did you ask an older student to put it
      into the Goblet of Fire for you?” Harry responded with the same answer,
      but this time in a forceful manner. This is how J.K. Rowling envisioned
      the character of Dumbledore: a wise and powerful headmaster who maintains
      his composure even in times of distress. I grew up reading these books and
      loving the characters and the situations they found themselves in. I loved
      the stories of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Snape, and even
      Voldemort.

      So, imagine the excitement of seeing your favorite books come to life on
      the big screen. You rush to the theater, eager to witness the world you've
      imagined, the characters you've grown to love, and the themes that have
      touched your heart. But as the credits roll, you can't shake the feeling
      that something essential is missing - the very soul of the story you
      cherished in the pages of the book.

      All too often, film adaptations of books fail to capture the essence of
      the original work. Essential plotlines are altered, beloved characters are
      watered down, and the depth of the story is compromised, leaving fans
      disillusioned and authors disheartened. In some cases, endings are
      completely changed. Spoiler alert, Edmund Dantes does NOT sail away with
      his beloved Mercedes in spite of what Disney's 2002 film would have you
      believe. Film studios have the power to shape the narrative, but what
      about the voice of the authors who poured their heart and soul into
      creating these masterpieces?
    </p>

    <p>
      My personal experience is not unique. Many of us have cherished books that
      have shaped our lives and have become a source of comfort, inspiration,
      and connection. When movie adaptations fail to capture the essence of
      these stories, it's not merely a matter of creative differences—it's a
      disservice to the millions of hearts that beat in sync with the author's
      words.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe it's time for change. We propose a simple yet powerful solution
      - a disclaimer before the start of movie adaptations that acknowledges the
      creative license taken by the filmmakers and encourages viewers to
      discover the full depth and richness of the story within the original
      novel. This disclaimer will serve as a reminder that while movies may be
      "based on" the novels, they are not a definitive representation of the
      author's original intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      By signing this petition for movie disclaimers, we can make a difference,
      respecting authors' hard work and ensuring that future adaptations honor
      the soul of the original works. Let's come together to protect the magic
      of storytelling and stand by the authors who have shared their imagination
      and hearts with us.

      Imagine for a moment, at the end of Casablanca, Richard Blaine decides
      that instead of letting Ilsa leave on a plane with her husband, she is to
      leave with Rick. Yeah. Not the same movie. That's what I'm talking about.

<h2 class="text-4xl text-center font-bold">Book vs Movie:</h2>

<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">Barty Crouch Jr. and the Pensieve Explanation</h3>

<p class="text-xl m-2"> In the book, there is a detailed explanation by Barty Crouch Jr. in the Pensieve about his actions, his father, and his impersonation of Mad-Eye Moody. This helps clarify some plot points. The movie omits many details from this explanation, leading to a less nuanced understanding of Barty Crouch Jr.'s motivations.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare)</h3>

<p class="text-xl m-2">Hermione's efforts to free house-elves and her creation of S.P.E.W. are more extensively explored in the book. The movie significantly reduces the focus on S.P.E.W., resulting in less character development for Hermione and a reduced exploration of house-elf issues.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">Ludo Bagman and Winky</h3>

<p class="text-xl m-2">Ludo Bagman's role in the Triwizard Tournament and his connections to the Weasley twins' bet are more emphasized in the book. The character of Winky the house-elf, who is dismissed by Crouch and plays a role in the Barty Crouch Jr. reveal, is mostly absent from the movie.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">Triwizard Tasks</h3>

<p class="text-xl m-2">Some of the challenges in the Triwizard Tournament are condensed or altered in the movie for pacing and visual impact.</p>

<!--p class="text-xl m-2">These are just a few examples of the differences between the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" novel and film. A more extensive list will be created when I have learned how to create separate pages for each book vs movie.</p-->
